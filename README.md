LogSD: Detecting Anomalies from SystemLogs through Self-supervised Learning and Frequency-based Masking

## Data

The log datasets used in the paper can be found in the repo [loghub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub).
In this repository, the BGL dataset under 100logs setting is proposed for a quick hands-up.

For generating the data files, please refer to the implementation repo of [deep-loglizer](https://github.com/logpai/deep-loglizer).


## Usage

The simplest way of running LogSD is to run `python logsd.py`.
